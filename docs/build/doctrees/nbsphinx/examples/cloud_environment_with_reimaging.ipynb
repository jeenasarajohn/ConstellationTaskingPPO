    "# Cloud Environment with Re-imaging\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the configuration and use of a BSK-RL environment considering cloud coverage and re-imaging capabilities. Two reward functions are presented: a single-picture binary case (where targets are deemed occluded by clouds or not and no re-imaging is allowed) and a re-imaging case where the problem is formulated in terms of the targets' probability of being successfully observed. Still, the satellite cannot observe the true cloud coverage of each target, only its forecast. The satellite has to image targets while keeping a positive battery level. This example script is part of an upcoming publication.\n",
